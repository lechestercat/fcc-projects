            on how to increase wheat yields - part of his life-long war on

          <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="bold-date">1914</span> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold-date">1933</span> - Leaves his family's farm to
              attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era
              program known as the "National Youth Administration"
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold-date">1935</span> - Has to stop school and save
              up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping
              starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All
              of this left scars on me."
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold-date">1937</span> - Finishes university and
              takes a job in the US Forestry Service
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold-date">1938</span> - Marries wife of 69 years
              Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by
              Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman,
              who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold-date">1941</span> - Tries to enroll in the
              military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead,
              the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to
              control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold-date">1942</span> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics
              and Plant Pathology
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold-date">1944</span> - Rejects a 100% salary
              increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies
              to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16
              years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease
              resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major
              climate on Earth.
            </li>
